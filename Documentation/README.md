# How to generate documentation website
- Be sure [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) is installed
- Be sure SceneLoading repository is on **master** branch
- Open a terminal
- Execute `cd .../SceneLoading/Documentation/`
- Execute `docfx`
- Be sure there is no issue with the generated site (execute `docfx --serve` to look at the result on localhost)
- Copy the `SceneLoading/Documentation/_site/` folder and paste it anywhere outside of the repository (like `.../Temp/_site`)
- In git, use `git checkout` to go from master to **docs** branch
- On docs branch, delete the old `docs/` folder
- Cut and paste the newly generated `_site/` folder (from `.../Temp/_site/` to `.../SceneLoading/_site/`)
- Rename `_site/` to `docs/`
- Commit the changes
- Push to github
