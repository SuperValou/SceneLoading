First, you have to put the correct labels on your scene files. Lets assume you have the following unity scene files:
- Initialization.unity being your Master scene
- Gameplay.unity being your Gameplay scene
- Forest.unity being a Room scene
- Beach.unity being a Room scene
- TitleScreen.unity being the main menu scene
- GameOver.unity being the game over screen

From the Editor, add the following labels on your scenes:
- Scene-Master on Initialization.unity
- Scene-Gameplay on Gameplay.unity
- Scene-Room on Forest.unity
- Scene-Room on Beach.unity
- Scene-Screen on TitleScreen.unity
- Scene-Screen on GameOver.unity

Once this is done, go to SceneLoading > Generate Scene classes. You'll now have the SceneId enumeration and the SceneInfo class available to load scene from your code.

Note that you can add your own types of scene if you want. Putting a "Scene-Foo" label on a scene file will register it as being of the type "Foo".

You can also go to SceneLoading > Load Scene > Generate Load Scene Menu to have a shortcut to load all your scene in the editor from the SceneLoading > Load Scene menu.
