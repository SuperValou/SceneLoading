## How to get the project running
This repo uses TextMeshPro. To avoid clogging the version control, TextMeshPro files were excluded from the repository. 
It means you'll have to do the following actions to get the project working properly:
- Clone the repository
- Open it in Unity 2019.2 or later
- Go to Window > TextMeshPro > **Import TMP Essential Ressources**
- Enter Play mode, then exit it to force the Editor to refresh
- The project should now be ready
