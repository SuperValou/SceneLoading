## How to get the demo project running

This repository includes a full demo of what you can do with this package. As it's both the sandbox from which the package gets developped and an actual demo of its features, a few tricks have to be applied to make the demo run properly (a tool to automate this process may appear at some point):
- Clone the repository
- Open it in Unity 2019.2 or later
- *(coming soon)*
